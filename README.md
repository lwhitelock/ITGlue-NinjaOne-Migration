We use the Magick.NET libraries that you can find here https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET/ for image type validation and metadata building.

Please review the licensed rights for Magick.NET here https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET/blob/main/License.txt

These are used only when the image extension was not properly retained in the export, and so we need to determine the type and rename them.
